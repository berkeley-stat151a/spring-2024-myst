# Schedule

% MyST does not yet give you the ability to have freestyle HTML with colors and styles. <span style="color: blue;">For example, this text should be blue, but it isn't.</span>

The table below is rendered by the `schedule` plugin, contributed by [rowanc1](https://github.com/rowanc1). It is declared in `myst.yml` and contained within `schedule.mjs`. It reads in the data in `schedule.yml` and converts it into a table.

:::{schedule} ./schedule.yml
