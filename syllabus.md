## Goals

To be able to:
1. Express standard regression analyses both mathematically and in R code
1. Critically relate the intended use of a regression analysis to its methods and assumptions
1. Identify common practical and conceptual pitfalls of regression analysis, and to fix the analysis when possible
1. Communicate the process and results of a regression analysis simply and clearly for a broad audience, using well-organized prose, reproducible code, and effective data visualizations.


## Some key concepts

- Modes of inference:
	- Descriptive statistics / exploratory data analysis
	- Prediction
	- Parametric inference
		- Frequentist inference
		- Bayesian parametric inference / inverse problems

- Perspectives on linear regression
	- Linear algebra + projections
	- ANOVA and one-hot encodings
	- Maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimators
	- Empirical loss minimization
	- Estimating equations

- Common pitfalls of regression
	- Domain transfer
	- Gross errors and outliers
	- Collinearity
	- Model reification
	- Model misspecification
		- Departure from normality
		- Biased error terms / omitted variables
		- Heteroskedasticity
		- Non-invariance under transforms
