## Goals

1. Design and conduct regression analyses in R for common data structures and research settings.
1. Interpret statistical models, estimates of model parameters, and inferences correctly.
1. Evaluate the quality of a regression analysis and suggest improvements.
1. Communicate the process and results of a data analysis simply and clearly for a broad audience, using well-organized prose and effective data visualizations.
